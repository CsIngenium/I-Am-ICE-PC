 ❄️ I Am Ice - PC❄️  
A frantic kitchen escape where you play as a melting ice cube!

 🎮 About the Game  
You’re a lonely ice cube trying to survive a dangerous kitchen! Navigate countertops, avoid empty glasses, and dodge heat-based enemies—all while racing against time before you melt into a puddle.  

- Genre: Fast-paced 2D platformer  
- Core Challenge: Balance speed and precision to avoid:  
  - 💧 Liquids: Fall into them, and you’ll melt instantly!  
  - 🔥 Enemies: Jumping flames and floating heat particles.  
  - 🕳️ Traps: Slippery countertops, plate obstacles, and more.  

My first Unity project! Just 2 levels, but packed with tense moments.
